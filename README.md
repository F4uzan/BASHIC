### BASHIC, A Simple and Horribly-coded Instruction Code

A "wrapper" for BASIC-like language. *DO NOT* use unless you really have a bad headache or you want to teach programming to the one _you hate the most_.

#### Okay, why does this exist?

I was bored, I had a text editor window open, and I had some spare time.

#### How to use it?

	source bashic.sh
	
Then do whatever `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

#### Is this even usable?

It works, and it's usable but why would you even use it?

#### Is there any meaning to this?

A preparation for 2018's April Fools' Day?

#### Can I contribute?

Sure. Why though?
